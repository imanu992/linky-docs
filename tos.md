## Terms of Service for Linky

### Introduction
Welcome to the Terms of Service of Linky, a Discord bot for server promotion. By using Linky, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the bot.

### Description of Service
Linky allows users to promote their Discord server within a dedicated server called “Linky’s Showcase.” Users can configure the bot on their server by providing: a bot-generated invite link, a description, and the server’s age. Once the setup is complete, the user must join the “Linky’s Showcase” server to use the self-promotion command “/bump.”

### Usage Requirements
- You must be at least 13 years old to use Linky (and Discord).
- You must adhere to [Discord's community guidelines.](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- You must be a member of the [Linky’s Showcase](https://discord.gg/EWzmtbZjEg) server to use the "/bump" command.

### Bot Configuration and Usage
- **Setup:** Use the command “/setup” to start the guided configuration. You can use the commands “/update-…” to configure the bot through slash commands. Users need to provide the bot with a description, set the server’s age, create an invite link via the bot, and set a channel where the bumping commands will be sent.
- **Self-promotion:** Use the /bump command to send a promotional message about your server to the Linky’s Showcase server. The command can only be used if you are within the Showcase server.
Why this system? If we hadn't imposed this "barrier," no one would have joined the Linky’s Showcase server to discover new servers.

### Rules of Conduct
- Do not use Linky to promote servers with illegal, offensive, or inappropriate content that violates Discord's ToS.
- Do not abuse the "/bump" command to spam promotions.
- Respect all users within the "Linky’s Showcase" server.

### Limitation of Liability
- Linky is not responsible for the content of promoted servers.
- Linky does not guarantee an increase in members or activity in promoted servers.
- Linky is not responsible for any technical issues or service interruptions.

We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. All users will be informed of any changes through the [#update](https://discord.com/channels/1256791280764063806/1256791281586409544) channel on the Linky’s Showcase server.
