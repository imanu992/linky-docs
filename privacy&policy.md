## Privacy Policy of Linky
Last updated: 08/07/2024 (dd/mm/yyyy)

Thank you for using Linky, a Discord bot designed for promoting Discord servers. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information.

### 1. Information Collected
Linky does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. Therefore, we have not connected any external database for data collection.

### 2. Bot Functionality
The only function Linky requires is the verification of information for the "/bump" command. To enable or disable this command, Linky checks if the user is present in the Linkyâ€™s Showcase server through the bot's variables. This verification happens in real-time and does not involve storing any information.

### 3. Use of Information
The information verified for the "/bump" command is used solely to determine if the user has permission to execute the command. This information is not stored or shared with third parties.

### 4. Security
Although we do not store any personal information, we are committed to ensuring that all interactions with Linky are secure. We use Discord's standard security measures to protect the integrity of the bot.

### 5. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with the new update date.

### 6. Contact
For any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you can open a ticket in the server.

Thank you for choosing Linky! ðŸ’•
